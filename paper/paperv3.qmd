# Introduction

Our hypotheses:

1.  Elephant seal reproductive success declines with age.

2.  Reproductive declines persist to the next generation (maternal effect senescence).Â That is, offspring survival and reproduction decrease with maternal age.

3.  Offspring sex ratios shift towards males with old age.

4.  Phenology (breeding haulout and molt haulout) is shifted later for older animals and breeders.

# Results

n = `r n_distinct(sealdat$animalID)` distinct animals, with `r n_distinct(sealdat)` total observations.

### H1: Reproductive senescence

We predicted that breeding success would decline with age. Based on the literature, we chose age `r age_senesce` to be the end of prime age and indicate the onset of senescence. If breeding success declined with age, we would expect to see a negative slope post-senescence (@fig-breeding-mod).

```{r}
#| label: breeding-mod

# Fit GLMMs to the data with binary variable indicating before and after onset # of senescence. We a priori chose age 11 for senescence (age_senesce).
breed_age_mod <- glmer(
  observed_int ~ age10 : age_cat + (1 | animalID) + (1 | year_fct),
  sealdat,
  family = "binomial",
  control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
)

summary(breed_age_mod)$coefficients

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-breeding-mod
#| fig-cap: "Breeding rates increased until age 10, then decreased from age 11 on. Black points represent mean and standard error of the observed breeding rates. The solid lines and shaded areas represent the mean and 95% confidence interval of the population-level model predictions. The observed data are unequally distributed across years, so the dotted lines indicate the predicted breeding rates averaged over years (i.e., including the random effect of year), weighted by the number of seals observed in each year."

### H2: Maternal effect senescence

We predicted that reproductive declines would carry over to the next generation - that is, pups born to older mothers would have decreased survival (for female and male pups) and reproductive success (for female pups). Pup survival significantly decreased with maternal age, but pup reproduction did not (@fig-repro-age).

```{r}
#| label: repro-age

# Isolate pup survival/recruitment 
surv_recr_data <- sealdat %>% 
  drop_na(pupID) %>% 
  # Only pups born 2016 or earlier (otherwise survival biased)
  filter(pupyearborn <= 2016) %>% 
  mutate(pup_surv_int = as.integer(pup_survived),
         pup_recr_int = as.integer(puprecruited)) 

# Fit pup *survival* model
pup_surv_mod <- glmer(
  pup_surv_int ~ age10 : age_cat + (1 | animalID) + (1 | year_fct),

  control = glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
)

# Fit pup *recruitment* model (female offspring only)
pup_recr_mod <- glmer(
  # NOTE: no random effect for individual bc singular fit
  # In survival model, 93 individuals (15%) had >3 pups (male+female pups)
  # In recruit model, only 17 individuals (4%) had >3 pups (female pups only)
  pup_recr_int ~ age10 : age_cat + (1 | year_fct),
  filter(surv_recr_data, pupsex == "F"),

Sample size n = `r nrow(pup_sex_data)` observations of `r n_distinct(pup_sex_data$animalID)` individuals.

**Note**: In the above figure, the population-level and weighted-average would lie directly on top of each other, so we've excluded the weighted average. This is because the random effect of year has very little impact on offspring sex ratio, which makes sense biologically. It's easy to imagine scenarios where reproduction would vary year-to-year, but harder to think of a mechanism linking year and offspring sex ratio.

### Phenology

Does the timing of breeding and molting suggest a mechanistic explanation for observed patterns in reproductive and maternal-effect senescence?

We fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model with the duration of a phase (molting or breeding) as the response variable and age, interacting with phase, as the predictor, using year as a random effect. We attempted to fit a model with random effects for both year and individual, but that failed to converge. We assumed the effect of year on phase duration (molting or breeding) was greater than the effect of individual, so we retained year as the random effect.

$$
\begin{align}
d &\sim NB(\mu, k) \\
\mu &= exp(\eta) \\
\eta &= \beta_0 + \beta_p * a + Zy
\end{align}
$$

Where: $d$ is the duration of the phase in days, $NB$ is the negative binomial distribution with location $\mu$ and dispersion $k$, $\eta$ is the linear predictor, $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_p$ is the coefficient for age ($a$) by phase (i.e., for $p$ in "molting" or "breeding"), $y$ is the year, and $Z$ is the design matrix relating $y$ to $\eta$.

## Selective appearance and disappearance

Age-dependent life history shifts can result from within- or between-animal changes [@vandepol2006]. We hypothesized age-dependent changes in reproduction were due to senescence, i.e. within-animal changes. However, it is possible that selective appearance or disappearance of animals in the population can create the same pattern. For example, if animals the breed more frequently have lower survival, then older animals will reproduce less frequently not because of senescence but rather because infrequent breeders disproportionately survive to older ages (i.e. selective disappearance). We tested whether our significant results (reproductive senescence, maternal effect senescence in pup survival) were influenced by selective appearance and disappearance, following the methods of @vandepol2006, by adding terms for age at first and last reproduction, respectively. We used AIC to compare the base model to models with selective appearance and disappearance.

There was no evidence for selective appearance or disappearance influencing the relationship between maternal age and probability of reproduction. The selective appearance model (i.e., included a term for age-of-first-reproduction) had a similar AIC weight as the base model. However, in the selective appearance model, the coefficient for age at first reproduction was not significantly different than 0 (`r h1_firstrepro_95ci`). As a result, the predicted breeding probabilities for animals that first recruited at ages 4 and 7 (the 10th and 90th observed percentiles in the population) were not qualitatively different than the predictions of the base model [@fig-selective-h1]. Therefore the observed pattern is consistent with the senescence hypothesis (i.e., within-animal change with age).

There was no evidence for selective appearance or disappearance influencing the relationship between maternal age and offspring survival. The selective appearance model (i.e., included a term for age-of-first-reproduction) had a slightly greater AIC weight than the base model. However, in the selective appearance model, the coefficient for age at first reproduction was not significantly different than 0 (`r h2_firstrepro_95ci`). As a result, the predicted breeding probabilities for animals that first recruited at ages 4 and 7 (the 10th and 90th observed percentiles in the population) were not qualitatively different than the predictions of the base model [@fig-selective-h2]. Therefore the observed pattern is consistent with the senescence hypothesis (i.e., within-animal change with age).

## Chronological versus biological age

```{r}
#| label: bioage

bioage_senesce <- -7
sealdat2 <- sealdat %>% 
  drop_na(lastrepro) %>% 
  mutate(bioage = age - lastrepro,
         bioage10 = (bioage - bioage_senesce) / 10,
         bioage_cat = factor(bioage < bioage_senesce,
                             labels = c("Old", "Young")))

```

The chronological age of an individual may not reflect their biological age because aging rates vary within populations [@martin2011]. Years-to-death, a proxy for biological age, may therefore be a better predictor for senescence patterns than chronological age. We repeated our analysis for the reproductive senescence hypothesis using biological age, setting the breakpoint for senescence at biological age -7 years (i.e. 7 years prior to final observation), based on visual inspection of the raw data. This required us to limit our sample to animals with known longevity (i.e., last observation in 2020 or earlier), which reduced our sample size to `r nrow(sealdat2)` observations of `r n_distinct(sealdat2$animalID)` distinct animals. Subsequently, we fit the model for breakpoints at all biological ages -10 to -3 years, to assess whether our results were sensitive to the choice of breakpoint. Finally, we re-fit the chronological reproductive senescence model using the known-longevity dataset and compared chronological versus biological age models using AIC.

The biological age model did not support the reproductive senescence hypothesis. The coefficient for biological age among older animals (biological age \> -7 years) was `r bioage_coef` (95% CI) which was not significantly different than 0 (*p* = `r bioage_pval`). Choice of breakpoint for senescence did not affect the significance of this coefficient. For breakpoints -10 to -3 years, *p* reached a minimum at biological age -7 years.

The chronological age model outperformed the biological age model according to AIC. The difference in AIC between the two models was `r sprintf("%0.1f", -diff(chrono_bio_aic$AIC))` and the chronological age model had an AIC weight of `r sprintf("%0.3f", chrono_bio_aicw[2])`.

Based on these results, we find there is evidence to support the reproductive senescence hypothesis based on chronological age. The biological age proxy, years-to-death, should be a better predictor of senescence than chronological age if most mortality is age-related. However, adult elephant seal mortality is largely influenced by extrinsic factors, primarily food availability [@colegrove2005; @holser2021]. Poor foraging conditions during El NiÃ±o years, for example, may increase mortality rates among animals whose biological age is not yet advanced. As result, the years-to-death proxy for biological age likely conflates many biologically young and old animals that died due to extrinsic factors. More accurate measures of biological age, such as telomere length [@jylhÃ¤vÃ¤2017], may be necessary to investigate senescence in elephant seals and other species with high extrinsic sources of mortality from a non-chronological perspective.

## Breeding state and detection probability

Not all seals were detected in all years. A non-detection year during the seal's lifespan (i.e. an unobserved year between the first and last observed years) could represent an unobserved animal at AÃ±o Nuevo or temporary emigration. In either case, the animal may or may not have reproduced that year. By excluding these unobserved animals, our inferences for H1 (reproductive senescence) may be biased if detectability varies with age and/or by breeding state. Here, we assess those potential biases.

First, we tested whether probability of detection was related to age. We found the proportion of unobserved animals increased with age. For this analysis, we excluded the first and last year of observation for each animal, because animals were necessarily observed in those years. For all years between, we determined whether animals were observed. Then we estimated the effect of age on probability of an animal being unobserved using a GLMM (binomial response, logit link) with random effects for year and animal ([@fig-unobserved]). The coefficient for age was `r missing_age_coef` (*p*\<0.0001).

The pattern of unobserved animals increasing with age means it is highly unlikely our inferences about reproductive senescence are due to partial detection. If there was no reproductive senescence in the population, then the apparent senescence we observed would have to result from older breeders being less detectable. However, the biology of northern elephant seals makes breeding a more detectable behavior than non-breeding. Animals must come to land for an extended period to give birth and wean their pups. Among the animals in this study, breeders hauled out for longer than non-breeders (1st - 3rd quartile: breeders `r breed_haulout` days; non-breeders `r non_breed_haulout` days). This extended period of time on the beach makes them more accessible to observers. Furthermore, northern elephant seals exhibit a high degree of site fidelity. Once they recruit to a breeding colony, temporary emigration is rare (cite me). The only plausible explanation for unobserved animals being disproportionately breeders would be crowding at the breeding colonies, which could obscure identifying marks. However, breeding animals were resighted `r breed_resight` times per year, compared to `r nonbreed_resight` for non-breeders (mean, 1st - 3rd quartile), which suggests that breeders are more readily observable than non-breeders. Therefore, it is biologically implausible that the unobserved seals were disproportionately breeders and our estimates for reproductive senescence are, if anything, conservative.
